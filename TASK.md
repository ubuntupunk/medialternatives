## 📝 Notes and Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 as primary framework (maintaining current design)
- **API**: WordPress.com public API (no custom endpoints available)
- **Deployment**: Vercel primary (subdirectory deployment), Cloudflare Pages backup
- **Project Structure**: frontend-app/ subdirectory to avoid legacy WordPress clutter

### Challenges Identified
- **WordPress.com Limitations**: No custom post types or endpoints
- **AdSense Integration**: Must be handled entirely in frontend
- **Analytics**: Need to implement tracking without WordPress plugins
- [x] **Header Image**: May need to hardcode or use WordPress.com site info API

### Solutions Implemented
- **AdSense**: Hardcoded React components with existing ad slots
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 + Vercel Analytics
- **Custom Features**: All implemented as React components
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for API failures
