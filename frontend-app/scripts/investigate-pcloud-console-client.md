# pCloud Console Client Investigation

## Overview

Found pCloud's official console client: https://github.com/pcloudcom/console-client

This could be a much simpler alternative to OAuth2 for our PDF migration needs.

## Potential Benefits

1. **No OAuth2 complexity** - Direct username/password authentication
2. **Official pCloud tool** - Maintained by pCloud team
3. **Command-line interface** - Perfect for our migration scripts
4. **No app registration** - Bypass Client ID/Secret requirements
5. **Simple integration** - Can be called from Node.js scripts

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Check Repository Details
- Language: C
- Official pCloud repository
- Command-line interface for pCloud operations

### 2. Installation Options
- Compile from source
- Check for pre-built binaries
- Package manager availability

### 3. Authentication Method
- Username/password login
- Session management
- Token handling

### 4. File Operations
- Upload capabilities
- Folder creation
- Public link generation
- Batch operations

## Integration Strategy

If the console client works well, we could:

1. **Install console client** as dependency
2. **Wrap with Node.js** for our migration script
3. **Use simple auth** with username/password
4. **Execute file operations** via command line
5. **Parse output** for URLs and status

## Next Steps

1. Test console client installation
2. Verify authentication works
3. Test file upload and public link generation
4. Create Node.js wrapper if successful
5. Update migration script to use console client

This could significantly simplify our pCloud integration!
